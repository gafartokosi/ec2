# Welcome to Gafar's EC2-bash Repository

# This bash script can only be used to start, stop or terminate an EC2 instance. Use terraform to launch

# These variables can only be used after two EC2 instances have been launched

This script makes use of static and dynamic variables; the static variables have been used to reference the instance-ids "a & b".

The dynamic variable "$1" will be used to specify whether to start, stop or terminate the instances using a for loop.

# Hope this is helpful, thanks!
